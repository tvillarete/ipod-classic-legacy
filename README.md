## Demo

## Details
This is a very early work in progress. I've gotten click wheel navigation working pretty well, though I'm still working through figuring out how to display all the different types of screens that the iPod user interface contains. 

This has been a fun engineering challenge, and I hope one day it'll be fleshed out enough to show off on Reddit :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
